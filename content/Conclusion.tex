In the future the next obvious step is to explore the possibility and requirements for camera tracking of natural markers instead of AR tags. Although AR tags are easy to use and quickly setup, they cannot be attached to arbitrary surfaces, either because of practical or simply because of optical reasons.

It might also be interesting to implement the ability for the robot to resume its previous task, i.e. to find its way back or to directly head to its destination to continue where it left off.
